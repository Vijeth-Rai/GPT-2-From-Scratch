# In-Depth Explaination Of Implementation

This README section provides an explanation of the code used to verify a custom implementation of the GPT-2 model from scratch. The following details describe the configuration setup and initialization of the GPT model.

#### Configuration Class

We start by defining a configuration class using a dataclass, which will hold all the necessary parameters for the GPT-2 model.

```python
@dataclass
class GPTConfig:
    block_size: int = 1024 # max sequence length
    vocab_size: int = 50257 # number of tokens: 50,000 BPE merges + 256 bytes tokens + 1 special token
    n_layer: int = 12 # number of layers
    n_head: int = 12 # number of heads
    n_embd: int = 768 # embedding dimension
```

- **GPTConfig:** This class encapsulates the configuration parameters required for the model.
  - `block_size`: The maximum sequence length the model can handle, set to 1024.
  - `vocab_size`: The size of the vocabulary, set to 50257, which includes 50,000 BPE merges, 256 byte tokens, and 1 special token.
  - `n_layer`: The number of layers in the model, set to 12.
  - `n_head`: The number of attention heads in each layer, set to 12.
  - `n_embd`: The dimensionality of the embeddings, set to 768.

#### GPT Model Class

Next, we define the GPT model class, which will be initialized with the given configuration.

```python
class GPT(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        self.config = config
```

- **GPT Class Initialization:**
  - The `GPT` class inherits from `nn.Module`, making it a PyTorch model.
  - The `__init__` method takes a `config` object as an argument and initializes the model's configuration.

This sets up the foundational structure of our GPT-2 model, defining the essential parameters and preparing for the implementation of the model's components. 

### GPT Model Components

Continuing from the initialization, the following sections describe the main components of the GPT model.

#### Transformer Module Dictionary

```python
        self.transformer = nn.ModuleDict(dict(
            wte = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.n_embd),
            wpe = nn.Embedding(config.block_size, config.n_embd),
            h = nn.ModuleList([Block(config) for _ in range(config.n_layer)]),
            ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd),
        ))
        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.vocab_size, bias=False)
```

- **Embedding Layers:**
  - `wte`: This is the token embedding layer, which maps each token in the vocabulary to a 768-dimensional embedding vector.
  - `wpe`: This is the positional embedding layer, which encodes the position of each token in the sequence with a 768-dimensional vector.

- **Transformer Blocks:**
  - `h`: This is a list of transformer blocks, created using a list comprehension. Each `Block` is initialized with the configuration and the number of layers specified (`n_layer = 12`). Each block contains the essential components like attention and feed-forward networks.

- **Layer Normalization:**
  - `ln_f`: This is the final layer normalization applied to the output of the last transformer block.

#### Language Modeling Head

- **Linear Layer:**
  - `lm_head`: This is a linear layer that maps the final hidden states from the transformer blocks back to the vocabulary size. This layer produces the logits for each token in the vocabulary, which are used for making predictions.

These components collectively form the architecture of the GPT-2 model. The embedding layers handle the input tokens and their positions, the transformer blocks process the sequence through multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks, and the final layer normalization and linear layer generate the model's predictions. 

### Differences from the "Attention is All You Need" Decoder Architecture

In this section, we will explain the key differences between the GPT-2 model's architecture, specifically the `Block` class, and the original transformer decoder architecture from the "Attention is All You Need" paper. We'll also discuss why these differences are desirable, particularly in terms of gradient flow and residual connections.

```python
class Block(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        self.ln_1 = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd)
        self.attn = CausalSelfAttention(config)
        self.ln_2 = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd)
        self.mlp = MLP(config)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x + self.attn(self.ln_1(x))
        x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))
        return x
```

#### Differences in Layer Normalization and Residual Paths

1. **Layer Normalization Location:**
   - **Original Transformer:** In the original transformer decoder, layer normalization is applied **after** the residual connections (post-norm). Each sublayer (self-attention and feed-forward) has layer normalization applied to its output.
   - **GPT-2 Model:** In the GPT-2 model, layer normalization is applied **before** the sublayer operations (pre-norm). This means the input to the self-attention and feed-forward layers is first normalized.

2. **Residual Connections:**
   - **Original Transformer:** The residual connections are added after the layer normalization and the sublayer operation. This can lead to issues where the gradient flow is not optimal, as normalization can interfere with the gradient signal.
   - **GPT-2 Model:** The GPT-2 model maintains a cleaner residual path by adding the residual connection directly after each sublayer (self-attention and feed-forward) operation. This structure is reflected in the `Block` class where the output of the attention and MLP (multi-layer perceptron) layers is added back to the input of the block.

#### Desirable Properties and Gradient Flow

1. **Cleaner Residual Path:**
   - **Gradient Distribution:** By adding the residual connections before layer normalization (pre-norm), we ensure that the gradients are distributed more evenly. This approach allows for a cleaner gradient flow during backpropagation, preventing the vanishing or exploding gradient problem that can occur with post-norm structures.
   - **Backward Propagation:** In this architecture, gradients from the top layer can flow straight through to the input stream. This means that during backpropagation, gradients can be propagated directly back to the input, as well as through the intermediate layers. This facilitates better training and convergence.

2. **Contribution of Intermediate Layers:**
   - **Intermediate Layer Contribution:** Each block in the GPT-2 model contributes effectively to the final output. The pre-norm configuration ensures that each block's output is well-conditioned before being passed to the next block, enhancing the model's ability to learn and integrate features across layers.
   - **Micrograd Influence:** Inspired by the micrograd framework, this approach ensures that the addition of residuals distributes the gradient signal cleanly across the network. This improves the stability and performance of the model during training.

3. **Overall Benefits:**
   - **Training Stability:** The pre-norm and cleaner residual path enhance the stability of training, making it easier to train deeper models without encountering significant gradient issues.
   - **Model Performance:** The architectural adjustments lead to better model performance, as each layer is more effectively utilized, and the gradients flow more efficiently throughout the network.

## Self-Attention and the Forward Pass in GPT-2

In this section, we will explain the self-attention mechanism and the forward pass within the `Block` class of the GPT-2 model. We will also discuss the concept of pre-norm layer normalization and the roles of the self-attention and MLP layers.

#### Forward Pass Explanation

The forward pass in the `Block` class of GPT-2 is as follows:

```python
def forward(self, x):
    x = x + self.attn(self.ln_1(x))
    x = x + self.mlp(self.ln_2(x))
    return x
```

- **Pre-Norm Layer Normalization:**
  - **Layer Norm 1:** The input `x` first goes through layer normalization (`self.ln_1`). This normalization step ensures that the input to the self-attention mechanism is well-conditioned.
  - **Self-Attention:** The normalized input is then passed through the self-attention layer (`self.attn`). The output of the self-attention layer is added back to the original input (`x`) to form a residual connection.
  - **Layer Norm 2:** The updated input (`x`) is then normalized again by passing through another layer normalization (`self.ln_2`).
  - **MLP (Feed-Forward Network):** The normalized input is then passed through the MLP (also referred to as the feed-forward network, `self.mlp`). The output of the MLP is added back to the input to form another residual connection.

This process ensures that the data is repeatedly normalized, aggregated, and transformed, allowing the model to refine its internal representations iteratively.

#### Self-Attention Mechanism

- **Communication Operation:**
  - Self-attention is a communication operation where all tokens in the sequence (up to 1024 in this case) can interact and share information. Each token can attend to every other token, allowing the model to capture dependencies across the entire sequence.
  
- **Aggregation and Pooling:**
  - In self-attention, each token's representation is updated based on a weighted sum of the representations of all other tokens. This weighted sum is an aggregation operation where the weights are determined by the attention scores.

- **Weighted Sum (Reduce Operation):**
  - The attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of the input representations, effectively reducing the information from all tokens into a new representation for each token.

#### MLP (Feed-Forward Network)

- **Individual Token Processing:**
  - The MLP processes each token's representation individually. Unlike self-attention, there is no interaction between different tokens within the MLP. Each token is transformed independently.

- **Map Operation:**
  - The MLP can be seen as a mapping operation, where each token's representation is mapped to a new representation through a series of transformations (typically involving linear layers and non-linear activation functions).

### Map-Reduce Analogy in Transformers

- **Attention as Reduce:**
  - Self-attention serves as the reduce operation where information from all tokens is aggregated to update each token's representation based on the entire sequence.

- **MLP as Map:**
  - The MLP acts as the map operation where each token's representation is independently transformed without considering the other tokens.

### Iterative Refinement of Representations

In a transformer model like GPT-2, the combination of self-attention and MLP layers allows the model to iteratively refine the representations of the tokens in the residual stream. Each block refines the token representations through a series of normalization, aggregation, and individual transformation steps. This iterative refinement enables the model to build rich, context-aware representations that capture complex dependencies and relationships within the input sequence.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in GPT-2

The `MLP` class in the GPT-2 model is a straightforward implementation of a feed-forward neural network, consisting of two linear layers with a GELU activation function in between. Here’s an explanation of its components and the forward pass.

#### MLP Class Components

```python
class MLP(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        self.c_fc    = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, 4 * config.n_embd)
        self.gelu    = nn.GELU(approximate='tanh')
        self.c_proj  = nn.Linear(4 * config.n_embd, config.n_embd)
        self.c_proj.NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT = 1
```

- **Linear Projection Layers:**
  - `self.c_fc`: The first linear layer projects the input from its original embedding size (`config.n_embd`) to a larger dimension (4 times `config.n_embd`). This expansion allows the model to learn more complex transformations.
  - `self.c_proj`: The second linear layer projects the expanded dimension back to the original embedding size (`config.n_embd`). This compression helps to integrate the complex transformations back into the original embedding space.

- **GELU Activation:**
  - `self.gelu`: The GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) activation function is applied between the two linear layers. It introduces non-linearity into the model, which helps in learning complex patterns. The `approximate='tanh'` argument specifies an approximation method for the GELU function.

- [Documentation on Gelu](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GELU.html)

### Understanding GELU and Its Advantages Over ReLU

#### ReLU Activation Function

- **Definition:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is defined as:
  \[ \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x) \]
  It outputs zero for any negative input and passes positive inputs as is.

- **Dead Neuron Problem:** 
  - **Flat Tail at Zero:** If any of the activations are zero, subsequent layers will receive zero input, leading to no updates during backpropagation. This results in "dead" neurons that do not learn or contribute to the model's performance.
  - **Issue:** Once a neuron becomes inactive (outputs zero), it may remain inactive, hindering the model's learning process and reducing its overall capacity.

#### GELU Activation Function

- **Definition:** GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) is defined as:
  \[ \text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x) \]
  where \( \Phi(x) \) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. The tanh approximation used in GPT-2 is:
  \[ \text{Approximate GELU}(x) = 0.5x (1 + \tanh[\sqrt{2/\pi} (x + 0.044715x^3)]) \]

- **Advantages:**
  - **Smooth Non-Linearity:** Unlike ReLU, GELU provides a smooth non-linearity that allows small negative values to pass through, which helps in learning richer representations.
  - **Continuous Activation:** GELU does not have a flat region at zero, meaning it always contributes to the activations, preventing the dead neuron problem.
  - **Faster Convergence:** By allowing more nuanced activations, GELU can lead to faster convergence and better model performance.

#### Efficiency Considerations

- **Original GELU:** The original implementation of GELU using the `erf` function can be computationally expensive and slow. 
- **Tanh Approximation:** GPT-2 and models like BERT use the tanh approximation of GELU to achieve a balance between performance and computational efficiency. The approximation:
  \[ \text{Approximate GELU}(x) = 0.5x (1 + \tanh[\sqrt{2/\pi} (x + 0.044715x^3)]) \]
  provides a faster, though slightly less accurate, version of the GELU function.

#### Modern Alternatives

- **SWIGLU and Other Activations:** More recent models like LLaMA have adopted newer activation functions such as SWIGLU (Switch Gaussian Linear Unit) that further improve performance and efficiency. These modern activation functions continue to build on the idea of smooth, continuous activation and better gradient flow, contributing to faster convergence and improved model capacity.

#### Forward Pass

```python
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.c_fc(x)
        x = self.gelu(x)
        x = self.c_proj(x)
        return x
```

- **Step-by-Step Process:**
  - **First Linear Transformation:** The input `x` is first passed through the `self.c_fc` linear layer, expanding its dimension.
  - **Non-linear Activation:** The output of the first linear layer is then passed through the GELU activation function, introducing non-linearity.
  - **Second Linear Transformation:** The activated output is finally passed through the `self.c_proj` linear layer, compressing it back to the original embedding dimension.

This straightforward structure of two linear projections sandwiched between a GELU activation allows the MLP to effectively transform the input representations. The expansion and compression steps help the model to learn and integrate complex features, making the MLP a crucial component in processing the token representations within the transformer blocks.

### Causal Self-Attention in GPT-2

The `CausalSelfAttention` class implements the self-attention mechanism for the GPT-2 model. Here, we explain the key concepts and operations performed within this class, including the concept of multi-head attention and how it is efficiently implemented.

#### Key Concepts of Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This is achieved by having multiple "heads," each of which performs its own attention operation in parallel. The outputs of these heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output.

- **Multiple Heads in Parallel:** The heads are not complicated individually; they are simply multiple streams running in parallel.
- **Concatenation of Outputs:** The outputs of these parallel heads are concatenated to form the final output.

In the provided implementation, instead of creating separate attention modules for each head, all operations are combined into a single attention module for efficiency.

#### Implementation Details

```python
class CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        assert config.n_embd % config.n_head == 0
        # key, query, value projections for all heads, but in a batch
        self.c_attn = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, 3 * config.n_embd)
        # output projection
        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.n_embd)
        self.c_proj.NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT = 1
        # regularization
        self.n_head = config.n_head
        self.n_embd = config.n_embd
```

- **Linear Projections:** The `c_attn` layer projects the input embeddings into three separate vectors (query, key, value) for all heads in a single batch operation.
- **Output Projection:** The `c_proj` layer projects the concatenated output of all heads back to the original embedding dimension.

```python
    def forward(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.size() # batch size, sequence length, embedding dimensionality (n_embd)
        # calculate query, key, values for all heads in batch and move head forward to be the batch dim
        qkv = self.c_attn(x)
        q, k, v = qkv.split(self.n_embd, dim=2)
        k = k.view(B, T, self.n_head, C // self.n_head).transpose(1, 2) # (B, nh, T, hs)
        q = q.view(B, T, self.n_head, C // self.n_head).transpose(1, 2) # (B, nh, T, hs)
        v = v.view(B, T, self.n_head, C // self.n_head).transpose(1, 2) # (B, nh, T, hs)
        y = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, is_causal=True) # flash attention
        y = y.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, T, C) # re-assemble all head outputs side by side
        # output projection
        y = self.c_proj(y)
        return y
```

- **Query, Key, Value Vectors:**
  - **Projection:** The input `x` is projected into query, key, and value vectors (`q`, `k`, `v`) using the `c_attn` layer.
  - **Reshape and Transpose:** The query, key, and value vectors are reshaped and transposed to bring the number of heads (`nh`) to the batch dimension. This allows parallel processing of each head as if they were separate batches.

- **Attention Mechanism:**
  - **QK Multiplication:** The queries and keys are multiplied to compute the attention scores, indicating how much focus each token should have on others.
  - **Causal Masking:** An autoregressive mask ensures that each token can only attend to previous tokens, preventing information from flowing backward in time.
  - **Softmax:** The attention scores are passed through a softmax function to normalize them so that they sum to 1.
  - **Weighted Sum:** The weighted sum of the value vectors is computed, where the weights are the normalized attention scores.

- **Reassemble Output:**
  - **Transpose and Concatenate:** The output of each head is transposed back and concatenated to form a single tensor.
  - **Final Projection:** The concatenated output is passed through the `c_proj` layer to project it back to the original embedding dimension.

### Variable Naming Conventions

In our GPT-2 implementation, we follow specific naming conventions for variables to ensure compatibility with the state dictionary of the original model. This allows us to easily load pre-trained weights and verify our custom implementation against the established model.

### Loading Pre-trained GPT-2 Model Weights

In this section, we explain how to load pre-trained GPT-2 model weights from Hugging Face's `transformers` library into our custom implementation. The provided method, `from_pretrained`, facilitates this process by ensuring compatibility between the state dictionaries of the two implementations.

#### Explanation of `from_pretrained` Method

The `from_pretrained` method is a class method that loads the pre-trained GPT-2 model weights and aligns them with our custom GPT-2 implementation.

```python
@classmethod
def from_pretrained(cls, model_type):
    """Loads pretrained GPT-2 model weights from huggingface"""
    assert model_type in {'gpt2', 'gpt2-medium', 'gpt2-large', 'gpt2-xl'}
    from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel
    print("loading weights from pretrained gpt: %s" % model_type)
```

- **Model Type Assertion:** Ensures that the provided `model_type` is one of the valid GPT-2 model types.
- **Importing Transformers Model:** Imports the `GPT2LMHeadModel` class from the `transformers` library.

```python
    # n_layer, n_head and n_embd are determined from model_type
    config_args = {
        'gpt2':         dict(n_layer=12, n_head=12, n_embd=768),  # 124M params
        'gpt2-medium':  dict(n_layer=24, n_head=16, n_embd=1024), # 350M params
        'gpt2-large':   dict(n_layer=36, n_head=20, n_embd=1280), # 774M params
        'gpt2-xl':      dict(n_layer=48, n_head=25, n_embd=1600), # 1558M params
    }[model_type]
    config_args['vocab_size'] = 50257 # always 50257 for GPT model checkpoints
    config_args['block_size'] = 1024 # always 1024 for GPT model checkpoints
```

- **Configuration Arguments:** Sets the model configuration parameters (`n_layer`, `n_head`, `n_embd`) based on the model type. The vocabulary size and block size are also set.

```python
    # create a from-scratch initialized minGPT model
    config = GPTConfig(**config_args)
    model = GPT(config)
    sd = model.state_dict()
    sd_keys = sd.keys()
    sd_keys = [k for k in sd_keys if not k.endswith('.attn.bias')] # discard this mask / buffer, not a param
```

- **Initialize Custom Model:** Creates a new GPT model instance using the configuration parameters.
- **State Dictionary:** Retrieves the state dictionary of the custom model, which contains all the model parameters.
- **Filter Keys:** Removes keys that end with `.attn.bias` as these are buffers, not parameters. Buffers are auxiliary states used in certain operations but are not updated through backpropagation.

```python
    # init a huggingface/transformers model
    model_hf = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_type)
    sd_hf = model_hf.state_dict()
```

- **Initialize Hugging Face Model:** Loads the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face.
- **State Dictionary:** Retrieves the state dictionary of the Hugging Face model.

```python
    # copy while ensuring all of the parameters are aligned and match in names and shapes
    sd_keys_hf = sd_hf.keys()
    sd_keys_hf = [k for k in sd_keys_hf if not k.endswith('.attn.masked_bias')] # ignore these, just a buffer
    sd_keys_hf = [k for k in sd_keys_hf if not k.endswith('.attn.bias')] # same, just the mask (buffer)
    transposed = ['attn.c_attn.weight', 'attn.c_proj.weight', 'mlp.c_fc.weight', 'mlp.c_proj.weight']
```

- **Filter Keys in Hugging Face Model:** Filters out keys that end with `.attn.masked_bias` and `.attn.bias` as these are also buffers.
- **Transposed Weights:** Lists the weight parameters that need to be transposed. The original OpenAI checkpoints use a "Conv1D" module, whereas our implementation uses a linear layer, requiring a transpose operation.

```python
    assert len(sd_keys_hf) == len(sd_keys), f"mismatched keys: {len(sd_keys_hf)} != {len(sd_keys)}"
    for k in sd_keys_hf:
        if any(k.endswith(w) for w in transposed):
            # special treatment for the Conv1D weights we need to transpose
            assert sd_hf[k].shape[::-1] == sd[k].shape
            with torch.no_grad():
                sd[k].copy_(sd_hf[k].t())
        else:
            # vanilla copy over the other parameters
            assert sd_hf[k].shape == sd[k].shape
            with torch.no_grad():
                sd[k].copy_(sd_hf[k])
```

- **Verify Key Lengths:** Ensures that the number of parameters in both state dictionaries matches.
- **Copy Parameters:** Iterates through the Hugging Face state dictionary keys:
  - **Transposed Weights:** For keys that need transposing, the weights are transposed and then copied.
  - **Regular Weights:** For other keys, the weights are directly copied.

```python
    return model
```

- **Return Model:** Returns the custom GPT model with the pre-trained weights loaded.

#### Ignoring Buffers

- **Buffers:** Buffers like `.attn.bias` and `.attn.masked_bias` are not parameters; they are auxiliary states used in certain operations (e.g., masking in attention). They are not updated during training, so they are excluded from the parameter copying process.

### Summary

The `from_pretrained` method ensures that the pre-trained weights from the Hugging Face GPT-2 model are correctly loaded into our custom implementation. By following specific naming conventions and handling transposed weights, we align our model's state dictionary with that of the pre-trained model. This process ensures compatibility and allows us to leverage the powerful pre-trained weights in our custom implementation.


### Verifying the GPT-2 Implementation

To verify the GPT-2 implementation, you can use the following script to load the pre-trained weights and ensure the model behaves as expected.

1. **Navigate to the Test Implementation Directory**

```sh
cd test_implementation
```

2. **Run the Test Script**

```sh
python "gpt2 implementation test.py"
```

This script will load the GPT-2 model with the pre-trained weights and perform a simple test to verify that the model is functioning correctly.

**Verification Message:**
If the terminal outputs "Did not crash," then you have successfully verified the implementation.

By following these steps, you will ensure that your environment is set up correctly and that the GPT-2 implementation is verified and ready for further development.


### Forward Pass Explanation

The `forward` method processes the input token indices through the GPT model to generate logits and compute the loss if targets are provided. Here’s an in-depth explanation of each step in the forward pass:

```python
def forward(self, idx, targets=None):
    # idx is of shape (B, T)
    B, T = idx.size()
    assert T <= self.config.block_size, f"Cannot forward sequence of length {T}, block size is only {self.config.block_size}"
```

- **Input Shape:** The input `idx` has shape `(B, T)`, where `B` is the batch size and `T` is the sequence length.
- **Block Size Assertion:** Ensure that the sequence length `T` does not exceed the model’s maximum block size.

```python
    # forward the token and position embeddings
    pos = torch.arange(0, T, dtype=torch.long, device=idx.device) # shape (T)
    pos_emb = self.transformer.wpe(pos) # position embeddings of shape (T, n_embd)
    tok_emb = self.transformer.wte(idx) # token embeddings of shape (B, T, n_embd)
    x = tok_emb + pos_emb
```

- **Position Indices:** Create position indices from 0 to `T-1`.
- **Position Embeddings:** Retrieve position embeddings using the position indices. This creates a tensor of shape `(T, n_embd)`.
- **Token Embeddings:** Retrieve token embeddings using the input indices `idx`. This creates a tensor of shape `(B, T, n_embd)`.
- **Sum Embeddings:** Add the position embeddings to the token embeddings. The position embeddings are broadcasted across the batch dimension, effectively aligning each token's positional context with its corresponding embedding.

```python
    # forward the blocks of the transformer
    for block in self.transformer.layers:
        x = block(x)
```

- **Transformer Blocks:** Iterate through each transformer block and pass the combined embeddings through them sequentially. Each block refines the representation of the input tokens.

```python
    # forward the final layer norm and the classifier
    x = self.transformer.final_norm(x)
    logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)
```

- **Final Layer Normalization:** Apply layer normalization to the output of the last transformer block.
- **Logits:** Pass the normalized output through the linear layer (`lm_head`) to produce logits of shape `(B, T, vocab_size)`. Each logit represents the unnormalized probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next token in the sequence.

```python
    loss = None
    if targets is not None:
        loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)), targets.view(-1))
    return logits, loss

- **Loss Calculation:** If target labels are provided, compute the cross-entropy loss between the predicted logits and the target labels. The logits and targets are reshaped to ensure proper alignment.
- **Return:** Return the logits and the loss (if targets are provided).

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Input Indices (idx):**
   - The input is a batch of sequences represented by token indices with shape `(B, T)`.
   - Each row in `idx` is an independent sequence of token indices of length `T`, where `T` is the sequence length and must not exceed the block size.

2. **Position and Token Embeddings:**
   - Position embeddings are created for indices ranging from 0 to `T-1` and are broadcasted across the batch dimension.
   - Token embeddings are retrieved using the input indices and are summed with the position embeddings to provide positional context to each token.

3. **Transformer Blocks:**
   - The combined embeddings are passed through each transformer block sequentially. These blocks consist of self-attention and feed-forward layers that refine the input representation.

4. **Final Layer Normalization and Logits:**
   - The output of the last transformer block is normalized, and logits are produced using a linear layer. Logits represent the unnormalized probabilities of the next token in the sequence for each position in the input.

5. **Loss Calculation (if targets are provided):**
   - If target labels are provided, the cross-entropy loss is computed between the predicted logits and the targets. This loss measures how well the model's predictions match the actual target tokens.

6. **Output:**
   - The method returns the logits and, if applicable, the computed loss. The logits are one softmax operation away from being converted into probabilities, representing the model's predictions for the next token in each position of the input sequence.

This process ensures that the model generates appropriate predictions for the next tokens in the sequence, allowing for the generation of coherent text based on the input context.


### Verifying by generating text

This code demonstrates the process of generating text using a pre-trained GPT-2 model. The code initializes the model, encodes an input prompt, generates text iteratively by sampling from the model's output probabilities, and finally decodes and prints the generated text.

#### Code Explanation

1. **Initialization and Model Setup:**
   ```python
   num_return_sequences = 5
   max_length = 30

   model = GPT.from_pretrained('gpt2')
   print("Did not crash")
   model.eval()
   model.to('cuda')
   ```

   - `num_return_sequences`: Number of sequences to generate.
   - `max_length`: Maximum length of the generated sequences.
   - `model = GPT.from_pretrained('gpt2')`: Load the pre-trained GPT-2 model.
   - `model.eval()`: Set the model to evaluation mode.
   - `model.to('cuda')`: Move the model to the GPU.

2. **Token Encoding:**
   ```python
   import tiktoken
   enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')
   tokens = enc.encode("Hello, I'm a language model,")
   tokens = torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.long) #(8, )
   tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0).repeat(num_return_sequences, 1) #(8, 1)
   x = tokens.to('cuda')
   ```

   - `enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')`: Get the tokenizer for GPT-2.
   - `tokens = enc.encode("Hello, I'm a language model,")`: Encode the input prompt into tokens.
   - `tokens = torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.long)`: Convert tokens to a PyTorch tensor.
   - `tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0).repeat(num_return_sequences, 1)`: Create a batch of sequences with the same input prompt.
   - `x = tokens.to('cuda')`: Move the tokens to the GPU.

3. **Text Generation Loop:**
   ```python
   torch.manual_seed(42)
   torch.cuda.manual_seed(42)
   while x.size(1) < max_length:
       with torch.no_grad():
           logits, _ = model(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)
           logits = logits[:, -1, :] # (B, vocab_size)
           probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
           topk_probs, topk_indices = torch.topk(probs, 50, dim=-1)
           ix = torch.multinomial(topk_probs, 1) # (B, 1)
           xcol = torch.gather(topk_indices, -1, ix) # (B, 1)
           x = torch.cat((x, xcol), dim=1)
   ```

   - **Set Seed:**
     - `torch.manual_seed(42)`: Set the random seed for reproducibility.
     - `torch.cuda.manual_seed(42)`: Set the random seed for CUDA.

   - **Generation Loop:**
     - `while x.size(1) < max_length`: Continue generating tokens until the sequence length reaches `max_length`.
     - `with torch.no_grad()`: Disable gradient calculation for efficiency.
     - `logits, _ = model(x)`: Forward pass through the model to get logits.
     - `logits = logits[:, -1, :]`: Extract logits for the last token in each sequence.
     - `probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)`: Convert logits to probabilities using softmax.
     - `topk_probs, topk_indices = torch.topk(probs, 50, dim=-1)`: Perform top-k sampling with `k=50`.
     - `ix = torch.multinomial(topk_probs, 1)`: Sample the next token from the top-k probabilities.
     - `xcol = torch.gather(topk_indices, -1, ix)`: Get the indices of the sampled tokens.
     - `x = torch.cat((x, xcol), dim=1)`: Append the sampled tokens to the sequence.

4. **Decoding and Printing Generated Text:**
   ```python
   for i in range(num_return_sequences):
       tokens = x[i, :max_length].tolist()
       decoded = enc.decode(tokens)
       print(">", decoded)
   ```

   - **Loop Through Sequences:**
     - Iterate through each generated sequence.
     - `tokens = x[i, :max_length].tolist()`: Extract tokens from the generated sequence.
     - `decoded = enc.decode(tokens)`: Decode tokens to text.
     - `print(">", decoded)`: Print the generated text.
